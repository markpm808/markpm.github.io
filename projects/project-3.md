Paniolos is a local restaurant that serves freash mexican food, such as burritos, tacos, and bowls. For my ICS314 software engineering class, I recreated the home page for the Paniolos restaurant using Semantic UI. Rebuilding the Paniolos page required me to create an exact look-alike of the home page by copying the background and menu buttons.

For this project, I learned a great deal about Semantic UI and how to inspect a webpage and learn about the way it is implemented. I learned that Semantic UI is a great framework to design usable, responsive, and attractive web pages. This project developed my website design skills and gave me a greater insight into how webpages are created.
