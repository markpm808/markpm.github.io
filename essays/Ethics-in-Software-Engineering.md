In today’s world, ethics is not only a part of a person’s daily life, but a part of their professional life too. The moral principles which govern how a person behaves can have a tremendous effect on them and the people around them. While some professional environments may be governed more closely by ethics, it is true that ethics indeed plays a role in every professional career, even those that seem unimportant to the greater good. Ethics in software engineering may sound less important or interesting than in other fields such as law and science, but it is indeed just as significant to the lives of everyone. 

In the field of software engineering, ethics can be the difference between a company who steals money from its customers and a company who is honest, trustworthy, and loyal to their customers. Often times people who are in software engineering may feel like their work less directly affects the lives of others than it really does. Maybe they wrote a program for a company that steals money from innocent people, but because everything is done through the software and not directly from themselves, they feel less responsible for the act. Software engineers hold a huge responsibility in writing and publishing code that is ethical and in line with what they believe is right. Just because a person may be instructed to write code that goes against what is right, doesn’t mean that they have a reason to do so because they simply just following orders. 
  
 A sample case study called “The Code I’m Ashamed of” gives a great analysis on the ethical implications found in software engineering. In the article, the software engineer makes a marketing quiz for a pharmaceutical company. The quiz, which recommends a particular drug in almost all cases, ends up leading to the death of someone who took the drug. While the software engineer ended up doing what he was told to and completed the project correctly, he still held the huge responsibility of upholding the ethical implications that would come from his work. The fact that he was the one producing the work and submitting it for people around the world to use shows that he is in some way connected to the consequences of his actions. 
 
In my opinion, software engineers hold just as much responsibly in regards to ethics as someone who is a mechanical engineer. Their work is just as important and can produce effects that reach people just as hard as someone who engineers a microwave for example. Staying true to ones ethics is important not only in their personal life, but especially in their professional life. No matter how powerless someone may feel in an event where they are expected to put harm onto others, it is their duty to stay true to their ethics and do the right thing.
