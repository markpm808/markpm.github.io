My experience with Meteor has so far been pretty good. Although it was initially very confusing and somewhat annoying, I have been able to get used to the way it works. Even though it has not caused me any big problems as of yet, Meteor has presented me with a few small problems that make my experience with Meteor much harder.

The first small problem that I had with Meteor is the amount of time I had to wait when I was setting up the Meteor application initially. Even after a few minutes, I am still sometimes forced to wait until everything has finished loading before I can start using Meteor. Not only is the Meteor applicaiton slow in the command prompt, but when the files used with Meteor are being setup on IntelliJIdea, the indexing time is usually at least six or seven minutes. This problem with Meteor is one that I have not been able to fix since it seems that it is just how Meteor is. My computer is pretty fast in my opinion, so I feel like my best way to resolve this problem is to just accept that I will have to wait for a long time initially when setting up Meteor. 

A second small problem that I had with Meteor was the overall complexity of the application. I was initially concerned that I would run into technical problems when running Meteor and setting up my work environment, but I have since been able to better understand Meteor and how to work it. Watching the instructional videos on Meteor has also helped me a bunch becasue I am able to follow step by step through the Meteor process to create web pages without much difficulty. 

My overall experiene with Meteor has been fairly good, despite the loading times I am still faced with when initially using Meteor. I have become more confident with how Meteor works and am excited to see the further things that I can do with it. In addition to the videos that walk me step by step and help me to understand the Meteor process, I also find the supplementary articles about Meteor to be extremely helpful. I am looking forward to learning more about Meteor and what it can do.
