After having worked with the Meteor framework for the past couple of weeks, I have slowly been able to gain a better understanding of the basic principles of Meteor, such as reactive variables, collections, publications, helpers, and templates. Despite the initial learning curve with Meteor, I now feel much more confident in my ability to work with Meteor and use it to create web applications. Along with the many useful features that I have learned to love about Meteor, there are also many parts of Meteor that I found to be very difficult.  

After working with Meteor for the past few weeks, my first impressions of Meteor as an application architecture are very positive ones. Having Meteor be the first modern, internet-based, client server application architecture that I have ever worked with, I found the experience to be very easy and understandable once the initial setup was complete. There was not a whole lot of problems or painstaking moments during my initial download of Meteor, which I liked a lot. Despite the long loading times for Meteor initially, I found Meteor to be quite fast and efficient for working with web applications. 

The parts of Meteor that I found the most difficult were understanding the different components of the Meteor framework and how they all fit together. I had trouble being able to understand some of the parts of code and figuring out what each part was used for in the web application. Even though it was easy to understand some of the concepts of Meteor, such as why certain files needed to be imported, I did not completely understand which parts of the application belonged to the server, the client, or both. 

What I liked best about working with Meteor was how you could see your application being built in real time and instantly see how any changes you made either fixed or broke the program. Using the command line, I could see the process of the application being built and be alerted about any errors. Also, it was very convenient when the application crashed in the browser because it would include error messages that alerted me to the exact line of code in my program that was causing the problem. 

Knowing what I do now about Meteor and how it can be used to build web applications, I could definitely see myself using the Meteor framework in the future if the situation ever arose where I needed to use an internet-based, client server application architecture. My overall experience with Meteor has been a positive one, mainly due to the usability and functionality that it provides to web applications. While my knowledge and understanding about using Meteor is still not where Iâ€™d like it to be, with more time I feel I can start using Meteor to its full potential.
